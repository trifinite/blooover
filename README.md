# Blooover - The Bluetooth Hooover 

This source code was written in 2004 as a J2ME MIDlet for Symbian phones supporting the JSR-082 Bluetooth API. It was a proof-of-concept tool showcasing certain Bluetooth vulnerabilities with certain handsets at the time.

The vulnerabilities exploited in this application do most likely not exist anymore, or the devices exposing these vulnerabilities are off the market.
