# Blooover - The Bluetooth Hooover

This source code was written in 2004 as a MIDlet for Symbian phones supporting the JSR-082 Bluetooth API. It was a proof-of-concept tool showcasing certain Bluetooth vulnerabilities with certain handsets at the time.

The vulnerabilities exploited in this application do most likely not exist anymore, or the devices exposing these vulnerabilities are off the market.

The code in this repository is not maintained anymore!
